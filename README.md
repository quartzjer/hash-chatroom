hash-room
=========

Experimental [telehash](http://telehash.org) based command-line chatroom app.

Run:
```
npm install
node room.js room@memberhash
```

The room name can be anything and you just need to provide the hashname of any other member of the same room to join it, or leave off the "@memberhash" to create a new room.
