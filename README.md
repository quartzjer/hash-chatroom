hash-chatroom
=========

Experimental [telehash](http://telehash.org) based command-line chatroom app.

Run:
```
npm install
node chat.js room@memberhash
```

The room name can be anything and you just need to provide the hashname of any other member of the same room to join it, or leave off the "@memberhash" to create a new room.  Try 42@32663be9a07889fccd78904fcbeae820a7ebb4869af9c6a956931de91c614748 and look for me (jer).
